Profit Targets

A financial analyst is managing a portfolio represented by an array of yearly profits, 
`stocksProfit`. The goal is to find the number of distinct pairs of stocks (profits) 
whose sum equals a given target profit. Distinct pairs are defined as pairs that 
differ in at least one element, meaning each pair should be unique.

Function:
The function `stockPairs(stocksProfit, target)` takes two parameters:
    - `stocksProfit`: an array of integers representing the yearly profits of stocks.
    - `target`: an integer representing the target profit for each pair.

The function should return an integer, which is the total number of distinct pairs 
where the sum of each pairâ€™s profits is exactly equal to the target.

Example:
Input:
    stocksProfit = [5, 7, 9, 13, 11, 6, 6, 3, 3]
    target = 12

Output:
    3

Explanation:
    There are 3 distinct pairs with a sum of 12:
    - (5, 7)
    - (3, 9)
    - (6, 6)
Only unique pairs are counted, and each pair should only be counted once.
